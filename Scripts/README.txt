This repo contains scripts from my final game design project. 
The game was a simple two-player space game called "Space Tanks... in Space". 
The objective is to survive for as long as possible as enemies spawn at increasing speed. 
Enemies can only be destroyed by bullets of the same color, requiring the player(s) to change color to defeat them. 
The unique mechanic of the game is that enemies will spawn in six different colors 
(red, blue, green, yellow, cyan, and magenta) while players can only change to between three 
(red, blue, and green). 
For the remaining three colors, the players must coordinate and collide to gain access to the three combination colors.

All assets were available for free online or though the Unity Asset Marketplace. All usage fell under Fair Use, and has 
only been used for education and demonstration purposes. 

The game was very well received during the peer review demonstration and was given an 'A'.
